# Recoil Course: Module 3 - Asynchronous Selectors and Derived State

## Overview

In this module, we focus on asynchronous state management using Recoil's selectors. The goal is to manage derived state that depends on asynchronous operations such as API requests or delayed data.

## Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand how to use asynchronous selectors in Recoil.
- Learn to handle side effects and data-fetching scenarios.
- Explore creating derived state based on multiple atoms.
- Combine atoms and selectors for enhanced reactivity and maintainability.

## Topics Covered:

### 1. **Asynchronous Selectors:**

- Introduction to async `get` functions in selectors.
- Fetching data from an external API (mocked or real).

### 2. **Error Handling in Selectors:**

- Handling loading and error states in async selectors.

### 3. **Derived State:**

- Creating selectors that compute values from multiple atoms.

---

## Checkpoint 1: Understanding Asynchronous Selectors

### Exercise 1:

- **Goal**: Create a Recoil selector that fetches data asynchronously (e.g., fetch a list of products or a mocked API).
- **Task**: Ensure the selector handles loading, success, and error states.

#### Hints:

- Use `fetch` or any other API request mechanism.
- Return a loading state while the request is in progress.
- Handle errors gracefully in the selector.

---

## Checkpoint 2: Combining Atoms and Selectors for Derived State

### Exercise 2:

- **Goal**: Create two atoms representing the user's cart data (e.g., `cartItems` with item IDs and `cartCount`).
- **Task**: Create a selector that derives the total price from the `cartItems` atom by fetching the price for each item asynchronously from an API or mock function.

#### Hints:

- Store `cartItems` as an array of item IDs.
- Use a selector to fetch the price of each item and compute the total.

---

## Assignment 3: Building a Full Cart System with Asynchronous Selectors

### Requirements:

- Create a mock API (or use a real one) that returns a list of items with prices.
- Develop a complete shopping cart system where:
  - Items can be added to the cart.
  - The total price is derived using an asynchronous selector.
  - The system handles API loading states and errors gracefully.

### Scoring Criteria:

- Proper implementation of asynchronous selectors.
- Error and loading state handling.
- Accuracy in derived state computation.
- Clean and maintainable code, with optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## NEW LEARNINGS BETTER TO NOTE IT DOWN

# useRecoilValueLoadable

`useRecoilValueLoadable` is a special hook in Recoil used to manage the asynchronous state of atoms or selectors. Unlike `useRecoilValue`, which assumes the value is either fully loaded or causes a component to suspend (if the value is not yet available), `useRecoilValueLoadable` gives you more control over the state of an asynchronous atom or selector. This makes it easier to handle loading, success, and error states explicitly.

## Purpose of `useRecoilValueLoadable`

This hook is mainly used to fetch asynchronous data or to load values that might take time, such as API calls. It allows you to handle three distinct states:

- **Loading** (`"loading"`): The value is still being fetched.
- **Has Value** (`"hasValue"`): The value has been successfully loaded.
- **Has Error** (`"hasError"`): There was an error while fetching the value.

## Key Difference from `useRecoilValue`

- `useRecoilValue` throws an error or suspends the component while the value is being fetched. It doesn't give you control over the "loading" or "error" state explicitly.
- `useRecoilValueLoadable` provides full control of the asynchronous dataâ€™s lifecycle (loading, success, and error) so you can display appropriate UI (like a spinner during loading or an error message on failure).

## Usage

```tsx
import { useRecoilValueLoadable } from "recoil";
import { fetchDataSelector } from "./atoms";

function App() {
  // Fetching loadable from Recoil state
  const loadable = useRecoilValueLoadable(fetchDataSelector);

  // Handle the loadable state
  if (loadable.state === "loading") {
    return <div>Loading...</div>; // Show loading state
  }

  if (loadable.state === "hasError") {
    return <div>Error: {loadable.contents.message}</div>; // Show error message
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {loadable.contents.map((ele: any) => (
        <div key={ele.id}>{ele.title}</div> // Render loaded data
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```
