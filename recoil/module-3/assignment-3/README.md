# Assignment 3: Building a Full Cart System with Asynchronous Selectors

## Requirements

In this assignment, you will build a full shopping cart system that utilizes asynchronous selectors to manage state. The key objectives are:

1. **Create a Mock API**:

   - Use a mock API (or a real one) that returns a list of items with prices.

2. **Shopping Cart System**:
   - Implement a shopping cart system where:
     - Items can be added to the cart.
     - The total price is derived using an asynchronous selector.
     - The system handles API loading states and errors gracefully.

## Scoring Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Proper implementation of asynchronous selectors.
- Effective error and loading state handling.
- Accuracy in derived state computation.
- Clean and maintainable code, with optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Good luck with your assignment!
